# Machine-learning-Stanford-University

These are my solutions to all the programming assignmentsMachine-Learning (Stanford University) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
